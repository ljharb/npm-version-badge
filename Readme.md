# npm-version-badge

Want to add a simple **SVG** badge that gets updated real-time as you increment your project's version in `package.json`?

```markdown
[![Version Badge](http://vb.teelaun.ch/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME].svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/[YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME])
```

Also check out <http://badge.fury.io/for/js> for normal PNG badges.
